#### Scenario - The Carnival Booking System

For celebrating the new year, we are holding a **5-days long Carnival**. Required by the sponsor of the carnival, we need to implement a “Carnival Booking System” , which will manage users’ registration, reservation and on- site checking-in of the Carnival. This system will allow people to register a user in it, when the user log in, he/she would be able to reserve a ticket for him(or her)-self. When the user arrives to the party place, he/she would be able to “check-in” offering his/her invitation code and corresponding password.
